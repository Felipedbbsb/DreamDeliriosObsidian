## Plugins used

**Excalidraw** is installed in this vault, to enable the drawing of mind maps, character or level sketches, and so on. Open the command palette, search for 'excalidraw'. Text in an excalidraw drawing can be linked to notes using the normal syntax of `[[` and `]]`. 

The **kanban** plugin is installed for some basic project management and task organization. One board is already [[Testing Plan Kanban|present]]. Click to drag a card from one column to another. Look for 'kanban' on the command palette to make a new board.

The [tag navigator](https://github.com/alexobenauer/obsidian-tag-navigator) plugin (not yet in the Community plugins) might be of value for some users. It creates a 'tag navigator' page that groups tags and subtags to give another perspective on the vault and a way to navigate through it.

Take a look at the **'Longform'** plugin (in the community plugins) might be one solution.

Another might be to install **Pandoc** on your machine, then use one of the Pandoc plugins to export directly from the source markdown to word, pdf, html. The various pandoc plugins give guidance on where to get pandoc and how to install it on your computer, and then how to get the plugin to use it.

**Git** is used for version control
