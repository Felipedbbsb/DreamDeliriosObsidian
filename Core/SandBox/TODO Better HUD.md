# Context

Players do not understand how dodge, ammo, leveling, and the multiplier combo work. This could indicate a lack of clear visual or gameplay feedback, making these mechanics less intuitive.
## Hypothesis

The HUD elements for **ammo, dodge, leveling, and multiplier combo** should be moved to the **dynamic HUD attached to the player**. Currently, only **recharging and dodge** are present in this dynamic HUD.

### **Ammo**
- Ammo could be included in the **recharging HUD**, displaying the remaining ammunition.
- The goal is **not** to show the exact count but to provide **immediate feedback** when the player is close to reloading, allowing better control over when to reload.
- Keeping the **original ammo HUD** is still beneficial to track the **exact** amount of ammunition.

### **Dodge**
- Dodge needs to be **improved** or given some **visual or gameplay reinforcement** to help players understand the connection between dodging and dodge stacks, which many do not notice.

### **Leveling**
- The leveling HUD should **keep its dedicated space**, but some **juice** should be added to the **player-attached HUD** when leveling up.
- The intention is to **reinforce the idea** that collecting drops leads to leveling up.
- The **leveling HUD needs improvements** to make it **clearer** when a drop is collected and the XP bar progresses.

### **Multiplier Combo**
- The **multiplier combo** should feel like a **game charm**, encouraging the player to maintain their combo.
- Due to the game's **fast pace**, it is hard to see the multiplier meter in a fixed position.
- This requires **additional juice** such as **shakes and SFX**, along with finding a **better placement** for visibility.
- A concern with placing it in the **player-attached HUD** is that it might take up too much space and obstruct the player's vision.


## Measuring success

Each UI element must be clear, intuitive, and enhance player decision-making without obstructing visibility. The design should reinforce gameplay mechanics, making information instantly readable and strategically useful.    UI elements must not clutter the screen or distract the player, aligning naturally with focus points. They should also be visually engaging, using juice and effects to enhance game feel while maintaining clarity. A well-balanced UI seamlessly integrates functionality and aesthetics, improving both immersion and player control.
