-  This template is designed to evaluate a feature or a recurring situation in the game, most likely after testing. It aims to analyze the issue, propose solutions, and determine whether the feature should be accepted or rejected. It is crucial to clearly mark the feature as either **approved** or **denied**, along with a justification explaining the decision.
