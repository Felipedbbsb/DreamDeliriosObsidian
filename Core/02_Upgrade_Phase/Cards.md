### Definitive Mechanics

---

#### #Deck
- The hand is limited to a maximum #HandSize #Stats
- Only cards in the #Deck affect the character.
- Cards can be bought on the #Shop or starts with it due to a #Character selected

---

#### #Rarity
- Cards can be **Common**, **Rare**, or **Epic**.  
- Most cards have a version for each rarity, while some are always **Epic** or Rare.  
- The rarity of a card is directly tied to its price and power level.

---

## Methodology
- **This methodology was developed to better plan card creation based on characters, archetypes, tags, and independence.
#### #Characters
- Personalities that aesthetically define the cards and possible archetypes planned in the mechanics design.  
- Characters act as groups of cards that share common #Tags, specific behaviors, and designs.
#### Archetypes
- Represents what a character can achieve with their cards.  
- It is interesting to imagine how different stats and specialized tags for each character can independently form multiple builds.  

##### Micro Archetypes:
- Builds created using cards from a single character.  
- These are the foundation for card creation in the first iteration.
##### Macro Archetypes:
- Builds formed through interactions between cards from different characters.  
- These are developed in a second iteration, potentially influencing the creation or modification of cards.  
- Macro archetypes can be stronger and less predictable, as interactions become exponential.

##### Planning with Independence:
- Each character should maintain independence during design to ensure their cards remain unique and impactful.

---

#### #Independence
- The scope includes 7-9 cards per character, for a total of 49-63 cards (not exceeding 55 due to scope limitations).  
- Each card needs to be mechanically and visually unique, altering combat in distinct ways (e.g., new projectiles, VFX, etc.).  
- Cards must be intuitive, so the player immediately understands their effect when used in combat.  

##### Balancing Dependence:
- Cards should not rely too heavily on specific builds to reach their potential.  
- A balance must be maintained to avoid making dependent cards too frequent.  
- Example: For every 2 cards dependent on a #Tags  (e.g., "Burn"), there should be at least 4 cards that trigger or support the tag.

---

#### #Tags
- Certain cards provide players access to tags, which are standardized effects that influence #Magnus.  
- Example Tag: **Burn**  
  - Cards may apply burn, enhance burn, or expand burn effects:  
    - "Increase fire rate for each enemy with burn."  
    - "Increase burn damage for each enemy with burn."  
    - "Burn damage now provides lifesteal."  

---
#### Independence Problem
- **Key Issue**: Cards should be unique and impactful without being overly reliant on tags or other cards.  
- Example Tag: **Burn**  
  - Cards dependent on burn are pleasurable and add complexity but can shrink the card pool.  
##### Proposed Solutions:
1. **Balanced Proportions**:  
   - For a pool of 8 cards, a maximum of 25% (2 cards) should depend on a tag.  
   - At least double the number of cards should trigger or support the tag (e.g., 4 cards causing burn).  

2. **Hybrid Cards**:  
   - Combine burn effects with interactions in a single card to reduce dependency while maintaining synergy.
